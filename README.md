## My Personal Next.js React Developer Portfolio

### A website to house my projects. 
## UTILIZING the Next.js framework and React styled components I've created a Portfolio in order to hold and display all my favorite projects AND the code plus steps I used to build them.
### A more extensive README file will be expanded upon in the next few days as this has just caught my attention of a must do.
