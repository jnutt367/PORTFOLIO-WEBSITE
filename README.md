## My Personal Next.js React Developer Portfolio

### A website to house my projects. 
## I used the Next.js framework and React styled components to build a Portfolio in order to hold and display all my favorite projects AND the code they were built wtih.
### A more extensive README file will be expanded upon in the next few days as this has just caught my attention of a must do.
